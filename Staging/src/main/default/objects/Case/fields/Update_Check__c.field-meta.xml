    <fullName>Update_Check__c</fullName>
    <description>This field is used to bypass a process builder / case trigger issue. The rules that prevent survey cases from being edited by anyone other than the managers public group or current owner were causing an error when coming back to update the case information for ownership log info. This fix allows the user(process builder flow) to make the update after the case is technically no longer owned by them and they are not in the public group. It just provides a brief window (5 or 10 seconds) that the case can be edited after the last modification.</description>
